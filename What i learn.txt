what i learn during this assignment:

1: Create classes instead of ID for applying css on the elements because ID is a unique attribute and is used for backend in javascript 
2: We can use already created classes for changing the CSS sttribute just add !important after the new property
3: if we change the behaviour of some element during resizing (like at 992px) and we again want to change  the behaviour
 at smaller screen like 576px etc  then too we need to add !important after property.
